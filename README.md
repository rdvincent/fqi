# fqi
C++ implementation of fitted Q iteration as in Ernst, Geurts, and Wehenkel 2005. 

Uses a simple implementation of extremely randomized trees, including both classification and regression.

With domains from my thesis and other continuous examples:
  * Mountain car
  * Bicycle balancing (Ernst 2005)
  * HIV (Adams 2004,2005; Ernst 2006)
  * Tass model of coupled oscillators
  * My simple model of fractionated radiation treatment for tumor cells.
  
Also includes some simple test cases based on data from UCI.
